					Steven Paul Jobs was an American business magnate, industrial
					designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief
					executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc.; the chairman
					and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney
					Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and
					the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a
					pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s,
					along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder
					Steve Wozniak.

					Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption.
					He was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended Reed College
					in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India
					in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.
					<br />
					Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I
					personal computer.Jobs became CEO of Apple in 1997, following his
					company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for helping
					revive Apple, which had been on the verge of bankruptcy.
